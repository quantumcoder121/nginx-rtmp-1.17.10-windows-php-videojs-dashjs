Download and unzip the most recent version of PHP in this folder. Overwrite all.
Make sure that the php-cgi.exe file is located in exactly this folder! Don't 
store it in a subfolder because our .bat file won't be able to find it then.

php.ini should have this uncommented and set to: "cgi.force_redirect = 0"

Download can be found on the official website at https://windows.php.net/download
